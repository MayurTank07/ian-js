- LOOPS ARE USED TO EXECUTE BLOCK OF CODE AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL CONDITION GETS FALSE. 

Types of Loops in JavaScript - 

    There are several types of loops present in JavaScript. Such as:

        1. JavaScript while Loop
        2. JavaScript do-while Loop
        3. JavaScript for Loop
        4. JavaScript for…of Loop
        5. JavaScript for…in Loop

    1. while loop --> 

        - first check the condition if its true then only execute while block.
        - while loop is also known as pre tested loop

        SYNTAX -->

            while ( condition )
            {
                //code
            }

       
    2. do-while loop  --> 

        - first execute the do block then check condition 
        - post tested loop

        SYNTAX -->

            do 
            {
                //code

            }while(condition);

    
    3. for loop --> 

        - first check the condition if its true then only execute for block.
        - for loop is known as pre tested loop
        - for loop has initilization , conditon, increment/decrement

        SYNTAX --> 

            for ( initilization ; conditon ; increment/decrement )
            {
                // code
            }
